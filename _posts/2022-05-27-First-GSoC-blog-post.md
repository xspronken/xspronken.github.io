## Introduction to my Project

Quantum systems are very costly to simulate on a classical computer which can result in exceptionally long computation times. This projects aims to create a benchmarking tool that could be run regularly and record results in order to track code efficiency across different QuTiP updates. The two recorded benchmarking metrics would be memory occupation and CPU instruction count (as well as time cost of each instruction) as these are a good proxy for computation runtime without having to take hardware into account. A benchmarking guide will also be made in order to be able to translate bench results into real-world timing and give users an idea of computation times based on the hardware they will be using.

### First tasks
The creation of this blog is the very first task of the project and will be updated every two weeks with the work that was done.
As the coding period has not started yet I will spend the next 2 weeks testing some of the libraries ad software required to perform the benchmarking. I will also be meeting the members of the Qutip team.
